\chapter{Discussion}

What else do I need? General discussion of the role of deep learning for medical
image analysis. Maybe.

Role of deep learning for medical imaging

advantages: fewer assumptions (manifold learning), generally applicable, learns
variability, less human supervision (segmentation), end-to-end-learning. Quick
adaption to new problems.

Challenges: large amounts of training data, how to get more labels? Data
augmentation. How to deal with large amounts of data? Scalability. Tasks deep
learning can be good at? Tedious and well defined tasks for which training data
is available, identifying landmarks, segmentation, classification of voxels for,
e.g., cancer cell detection. Why? Because a single image can provide a lot of
data. For per-image deep learning need a lot of data. Finding patterns in
images, diagnosis. Current models not sensitive enough, but if more sensitive,
they might overfit.
