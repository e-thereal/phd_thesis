Introduction:

- Start with a general introduction to MS
- MRI has revolutionized how we see diseases.
- Can make changes visible that we couldn't see otherwise.
- Important to quantify changes observed in MRI. (problem statement)
- Objectives: - quantify overall brain changes -> manifold learning
              - segmentation of MS lesions
- Developed methods based on deep belief networks and artificial neural networks to solve both problems.
- Outline of the thesis:
  - Methods described in the thesis are based on deep belief networks and convolutional neural networks. The necessary background to follow the thesis is layed out in the chapter 2 with a brief introduction to DBNs and CNNs.
  - DBNs and CNNs were originally developed with small 2D images in mind. Chapter 3 explains modifications to the training algorithm and model to facilitate the training on entire 3D volumes.
  - Potential applications: Manifold learning, modelling variability of morphology and lesion distribution, lesion segmentation
  - Thesis closes with a discussion of deep learning vs. traditional approaches and future challenges
    - Use more data, handle variability better, age of large data is perfect for deep learning
    - No assumptions other than test data should be similarily distributed than training data -> robust and fast
    - What can we learn from it? Need visualization of what the network is thinking. Probably relearn what the NN is doing similar to how brain research works: learn from good and bad cases or from deactivating certain parts of the network to infer what it does.
    - Theory of learning combining neuroscience and computer science

Background (what is deep learning)

- General introduction
- DBNs + general training procedure
- NNs + general training procedure
- Discussion
  - DBNs and NNs are different models, but also share a lot of similarities
  - Inference of hidden units same as inference in NN
  - Parameters are compatible meaning a DBN and NN with the same parameters would produce the same output
  - Inference of visible units similar to backpropagation except for the bias terms and the nonlinearity
  - However, different interpretation of the mathematical models leads to different objective functions
  - NN needs output for training. Output only known at the last layer.

Training in the frequency domain

- General introduction
- Motivation why special treatment

Manifold Learning

- General introduction
- Related work and challenges (AD and MS)
- Why is deep learning promissing
  - No similarity measure required

- Manifold of MRIs of AD patients
  - Describe the model, what goes in, what comes out, why are we doing this
  - Adjust for medical images, mask background
  - Evaluation
- Variability of morphology and lesion distribution in MS
  - Describe the model and the rational behind it
  - Evaluation
- Discussion
