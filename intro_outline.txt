Multiple sclerosis

What is it?

+ chronic, degenerative disease, demyelinating, inflammatory
+ Central nervous system (brain + spinal chord)
+ damage of mylin sheaths that act as insulating covers of nerve cells of the CNS
+ disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate
+ Cause of the disease not completely understood
+ Characterized by the formation of inflamatory and demyelinating lesions
+ Presumably caused by attacks on the myelin sheaths by the body's own immune system
- Pathology originates at the cellular level
- many aspects not well understood
+ Characteristic but not specific signs of tissue damage
- most recognizable of which are white matter lesions (WMLs), global and regional brain atrophy or shrinkage due to degeneration

How does it present itself?

- Very heterogeneous
- lesions can form in all parts of the CNS, resulting in a wide range of signs and symptoms
- Physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems
- Large range of severity of symptoms
- Physical signs and symptoms
  - loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation (e.g., tingling, pins and needles or numbess)
  - muscle weakness
  - difficulty in moving
  - difficulties with coordinatin and balance
  - problems with speech or swallowing
  - visual problems (optic neuritis)
  - feeling tired
  - accute or chronic pain
  - bladder and bowel difficulties
- mental problems
  - Difficulties thinking
- psychiatric problems
  - Emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood

Typical course

- Unpredictable
- Most patients (80%) are initially diagnosed as having relapsing remitting MS (RRMS)
  - Inflammatory attacks formation of new lesions, worsening of symptoms
  - Periods of remission and recovery
- Majority (65%) transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS)
  - unremitting and progressive accumulation of disability
  - Too much damage to compensate
  
Treatment

- No cure
- Symptomatic management
- Prevention of further damage
- But variable degrees of effectiveness.

Biomarkers [Biomarkers in Multiple Sclerosis: An Up-to-Date Overview]

- characteristic that is objectivly measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes,
  pathogenic process or pharmacological response to a therapeutical intervention.
- Classified by where it comes from: CSF, blood, urine, tears, saliva, imaging methods
- Classified what is measured: generic-immunogenetic, laboratorial, imaging biomarkers
- Classified by the purpose:
  - diagnostic (risk of MS, differentiate between other neurodegenerative diseases, early diagnosis)
  - phenotypical expression (aggressive, benign, malignant MS)
  - demyelination-neuroinflammation-replase
  - axonal loss-neurodegeneration
  - Prognostic biomarkers--biomarker of disability progression
  - Biomarkers of therapeutical response

Monitoring the disease

- Using MRI
- non-invasive monitoring in the clinic and to further our understanding of the disease
- Development of biomarkers important for tracking disease progression and treatment effect
- What are biomarkers? Go into more detail here from the review
- Focus on imaging biomarkers
- Some of them are based on global atrophy
- Some of them are based on delination of lesions -> lesion count, lesion load
- How to derive biomarkers reliably -> robust and accurate segmentation of tissues and lesions
  - Segmentation of brain performed reliably (list some tools that do it well and how well they do it)
  - Segmentation of lesions an open research problem, because they are much more challenging to segment
    due to the large variabiliy in contrast, shape, size, and location
  
- Using disability tests, describe some of them
  - EDSS standardized scale of disability ranging from 0 (no disability) to 10 (death by MS), captures mostly physical disability
  - MSFC composite score of lower limb timed (25 feet walk), upper limb (9-hole peg test), congnitive function (PASAT)
- Advantage, direct impact on patient's life
- However, don't correlate well with volumetric measures for several reasons
- Simple biomarkers correlate only modestly with clinical disability scores
  - Difficult to score
    - Subject to bias, smart people perform generally better independent of the disease state
    - Experience of the cognitive tests affects the outcome
  - Neuroplasticity
    - Brain can compensate for damage especially in the RRMS phase
    - Increased progress of the disease not reflected by perceived disability
  - Conventional MRI does not capture all aspects of MS
  - Volumetric measures do not account for potentially important structural changes or spatial dispersion of lesions
  - Traditionally strong emphasis on interpretability
    - Simple regression models
-> How to capture variability that goes beyond simple volumetric measures?

Objectives

- Development of a robust and accurate segmentation method
- Development of a method that can capture changes in brain morphological and lesion distribution

Overview and contribution

Both developed methods are based on methods known as deep learning, a field within machine learning that is inspired by the feature learning capabilities
of the brain. The vision is that solving a problem can be learned directly from the training data without a feature extraction step. Useful features are
automatically learned embedded in a feature hierarchy. Motivated by the learning capabilities of cats visual cortex. Learn features that are tuned for the
input domain and task.

Deep learning has been successfully used in many areas such as speech recognition, natural language processing, object recognization, object
detection and semantic segmentation. Success due to the ability to model variability in the data in form of a feature hierarchy. Robustness to large variability
learned from large training sets motivates us to use deep learning for lesion segmentation, which is challenging especially due to the large variability in
lesion size, shape, contrast and location, as well is the large variability of imaging contrast and imaging artifacts produced by different MRI scanners.
But deep learning not only good for building feature hierarchies that are robust to large variability. You can also use them to model variability directly from
training images, without making assumptions on the underlying data (such as local linearity of the ambient space) and without the need of a similarity measure.
Free of those assumptions allows it to learn an unbiased model of variability without imposing any expection on the learned manifold. Furthermore, highly nonlinear.
Can capture nonlinear variability. Motivates the use for manifold learning to model the variability in brain morphology and lesion distribution. However, deep
learing methods developed for small 2D images. Training on large 3D volumes too slow to be feasible and requires a lot of GPU memory when out-of-the-box solutions
are used.

- To train deep learning models on medical images, we have developed a novel training method that performs training in the frequency domain and is much faster
  than training in the spatial domain.
- Based on our deep learning frame, we have developed a lesion segmentation method that is robust to a large range of lesion sizes and contrast produced by
  different scanners used at different scanning sites. Compares favourably on two small publicly available datasets. However, true benefit is leveraging large
  datasets.  In a direct comparison on a large dataset from a multicenter MS clinical trial, outperforms EMS, Lesion-TOADS, LGA, LPA, SLS, and RNMSM.
- Also based on our deep learning frame, developed a method that captures changes in brain morphology and lesion distribution with a few parameters. Those
  parameters show improved correlation with clinical scores compared to estabilished imaging biomarkers.

Outline

This thesis is structured as follows:

- Chapter 2 gives short introduction to the field of deep learning and two deep learning models used in this thesis, namely DBNs and neural networks
- Chapter 3 gives full details of training in the spatial domain as well as our novel training algorithm in the frequency domain. Motivate it!
- The two main applications, i.e., lesion segmentation and manifold learning for biomarker discovery are described in chapter 4 and 5.
- Thesis closes with a discussion of deep learning vs. traditional approaches and future challenges
  - Use more data, handle variability better, age of large data is perfect for deep learning
  - No assumptions other than test data should be similarily distributed than training data -> robust and fast
  - What can we learn from it? Need visualization of what the network is thinking. Probably relearn what the NN is doing similar to how 
    brain research works: learn from good and bad cases or from deactivating certain parts of the network to infer what it does.
